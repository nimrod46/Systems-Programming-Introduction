  3 Yesterday
  1 All my trouble seemed so far away
  1 Now it looks as though they're here to stay
  3 Oh, I believe in yesterday
  1 Suddenly
  1 I'm not half the man I used to be
  1 There's a shadow hanging over me
  1 Oh, yesterday came suddenly
  2 Why she had to go, I don't know
  2 She wouldn't say
  2 I said something wrong
  2 Now I long for yesterday
  3 Yesterday
  2 Love was such an easy game to play
  2 Now I need a place to hide away
  3 Oh, I believe in yesterday
  2 Why she had to go, I don't know
  2 She wouldn't say
  2 I said something wrong
  2 Now I long for yesterday
  3 Yesterday
  2 Love was such an easy game to play
  2 Now I need a place to hide away
  3 Oh, I believe in yesterday
